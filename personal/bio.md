# About Me

I am a climate scientist and machine learning researcher currently completing my MS in Climate Science at [George Mason University](https://www.gmu.edu/). My research focuses on using physics-informed machine learning to predict urban land surface temperatures, combining satellite remote sensing with neural operators.

With over a decade of experience spanning climate research, geospatial data science, and statistical consulting, I bring a unique interdisciplinary perspective to solving complex environmental challenges. I am the author of two international books on GIS and remote sensing, and have contributed to peer-reviewed research on climate extremes, aquaculture economics, and climate data tools.
